## Intro :
eSentimental is a full-stack sentiment analysis platform built for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), developed using Next.js with shadcn/ui components for rapid and consistent UI implementation. The project follows a collaborative AI-assisted development approach (“vibe coding”) to accelerate build time while maintaining code quality and technical ownership. We are also training a custom AI model tailored to policy and stakeholder feedback to power the analysis layer of the application.
